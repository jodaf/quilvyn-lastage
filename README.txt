<h2>MN2E Scribe Module Notes</h2>

<h3>Usage Notes</h3>
<p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Racial origin choices (e.g., Plains/Urban Sarcosan, Clan/Kurgun Dwarf) are
    absorbed into the list of races.
  </li><li>
    Scribe lists Greater Conjuration and Greater Evocation as separate schools
    and uses Conjuration and Evocation to represent the lesser variety.  This
    simplfies the spell list and treats legate and druid spells from these
    schools as the lesser variety.  It also makes the Greater Spellcasting feat
    moot; use Spellcasting (Greater Conjuration) or Spellcasting (Greater
    Evocation) instead.
  </li><li>
    The MN rule book uses several feature names multiple times with different
    effects.  For example, Orc "Cold Resistance" feature grants immunity to
    non-lethal damage and half damage from lethal cold, while the Northblooded
    and Seaborn feature of the same name grants damage reduction.  In these
    cases Scribe uses a different name for one of the features in order to
    remove the ambiguity.  The renamed features are: Orc "Cold Resistance"
    (renamed "Improved Cold Hardy" to distinguish from the Northblooded and
    Seaborn feature); Chanceborn "Survivor" (renamed "Persistence" to
    distinguish from the Fighter feature); Insurgent Spy "Conceal Magic"
    (renamed "Conceal Aura" to distinguish from the Bane Of Legates feature);
    Pureblood "Skill Mastery" (renamed "Skill Fixation" to distinguish from the
    Wildlander feature); Spellsoul "Resistance" (renamed "Improved Spell
    Resistance" to distinguish from other resistance features); Tactician
    "Coordinated Attack" (renamed "Joint Attack" to distinguish from the Wogren
    Rider feature); prestige class "Improved Spellcasting" (split into "Art Of
    Magic" and bonus spells and points to distinguish from the Dragonblooded
    feature).  Also, the Survival bonus granted by the Mountainborn
    "Mountaineer" feature is treated as a separate feature ("Mountain
    Survival") for consistency with the Dwarf "Mountaineer" feature.
  </li><li>
    In situations where a feature has very different effects at different
    character levels, Scribe uses a different feature name for each effect.
    For example, the Giantblooded "Size Features" feature is replaced by
    "Obvious" at level 1, "Large" at level 10, and "Extra Reach" at level 20.
    Other instances: Ironborn level 14 "Improved Healing" becomes "Ability
    Recovery"; Mountaineer's "Ambush" becomes "Improved Ambush", "Quick
    Ambush", and "Sniping Ambush" at levels 8, 13, and 18; Painless
    "Retributive Rage" becomes "Improved Retributive Rage" at level 14;
    Steelborn "Untouchable" becomes "Improved Untouchable" at level 19;
    Sunderborn "Spirit Sight" becomes "Darkvision", "Magical Darkvision", and
    "See Invisible" at levels 7, 13, and 19; Tactician "Aid Another" becomes
    "Aided Combat Bonus" at level 5; Aradil's Eye "Alter Ego" becomes "Quick
    Alteration" and "Nonmagical Alteration" at levels 5 and 9; Whisper Adept
    "Whisper Sense" becomes "Whisper Initiative", "Whisper Surprise", "Whisper
    Clairaudience", "Whisper Clairvoyance", and "Whisper Commune" at levels 2,
    4, 6, 8, and 10.
  </li><li>
    The MN rule book incorrectly lists "Bear's Endurance" as a spell acquired
    at the level 4 Beast heroic path.  Scribe corrects this to "Bull's
    Endurance".
  </li><li>
    The Wogren Rider selectable features "Improved Ride By Attack", "Improved
    Spirited Charge", and "Improved Trample" only apply if the character
    already has the corresponding unimproved feat.  Select the "Ride By
    Attack", "Spirited Charge", and "Trample" selectable features otherwise.
  </li><li>
    The selectable feature list includes "Alertness" and "Improved Initiative"
    directly, instead of the Wildlander "Rapid Response" trait that allows a
    choice between these two feats.  Similarly, the selectable feature list
    separates "Initiative Bonus" from "Danger Sense", since "Danger Sense"
    requires choosing between initiative and listen/spot bonuses after level 1.
  </li>
</ul>
</p>

<h3>Limitations</h3>
<p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Language synergy is not reported.
  </li><li>
    Scribe does not report a validation error for a character with pidgin
    language competence in Courtier or High Elven.  Note that the Midnight rule
    book violates this rule by specifying that Orcs have pidgin competence in
    High Elven.
  </li>
</ul>
