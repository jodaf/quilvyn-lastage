This package contains a plug-in that allows the Scribe Character Editor to
work with characters from the second edition of the dark fantasy campaign
setting from Fantasy Flight Games.  To install it, copy LastAge.js and ogl.txt
into your Scribe installation directory (the latter replaces the version of
ogl.txt that comes with Scribe), then add 'LastAge.js' to the
CUSTOMIZATION_URLS array in your installation's scribe.html.  If you also want
to use the LastAge prestige classes, copy LastAgePrestige.js into your Scribe
installation directory and add 'LastAgePrestige.js' to the CUSTOMIZATION_URLS
array.
