## Midnight plugin for Quilvyn RPG character sheet generator

The quilvyn-lastage package bundles modules that extend Quilvyn to work with
the Midnight campaign setting, applying the rules of the
<a href="http://darknessfalls.leaderdesslok.com/">2nd edition Core Rulebook</a>.

### Requirements

quilvyn-lastage relies on the core and srd35 modules installed by the
quilvyn-core package.

### Installation

To use quilvyn-lastage, unbundle the release package into a plugins/
subdirectory within the Quilvyn installation directory, then add or uncomment
the 'plugins/LastAge.js' entry in the PLUGINS definition in quilvyn.html. An
entry for 'plugins/LastAgePrestige.js' can also be added or uncommented to use
the Core Rulebook prestige classes. 

### Usage

Once the Pathfinder plugin is installed as described above, start Quilvyn and
choose Last Age from the Rules menu in the editor window.
